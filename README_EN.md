## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Microservices Division Principles
1. **Clear Business Boundaries**: Each service has clear business responsibilities
2. **Data Independence**: Each service owns independent data storage
3. **Technology Stack Flexibility**: Choose the most suitable technology based on service characteristics
4. **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed and scaled independently

### Data Consistency Strategy
1. **Eventual Consistency**: Achieve cross-service data synchronization through event-driven approach
2. **Compensating Transactions**: Saga pattern for handling distributed transactions
3. **Idempotent Design**: Ensure retry safety
4. **Data Synchronization Mechanism**: Asynchronous message queues

### Service Communication Patterns
1. **Synchronous Communication**: HTTP/REST API for real-time queries
2. **Asynchronous Communication**: Message queues for business events
3. **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes built-in service discovery
4. **Load Balancing**: Kubernetes-based automatic load balancing

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: 80%+ code coverage for each service
2. **Integration Testing**: Inter-service interface testing
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete business process testing
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking

### Monitoring and Operations
1. **Application Monitoring**: Metrics, logs, distributed tracing
2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Resource usage, network, storage
3. **Business Monitoring**: Key business metrics tracking
4. **Alerting Mechanism**: Multi-level alerting strategy

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy
1. **Service Instance Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization
2. **Database Scaling**: Read-write separation, sharding strategies
3. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching architecture
4. **CDN Integration**: Global distribution of static resources

### Future Evolution Path
1. **Service Mesh**: Istio integration for enhanced inter-service communication
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Introduction of Kafka and other message middleware
3. **Serverless Integration**: Lambda/Function as a Service
4. **AI/ML Integration**: Recommendation systems, intelligent search
